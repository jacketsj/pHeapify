\section*{Overview}
\subsection*{Background Information}
\indent A heap is a nearly complete binary tree used for priority queues that satisfies the heap property: All nodes are greater than their children.
In particular, a heap is (in this case), represented as an array, with the node at index $i$'s children stored at indeces $2i+1$ and $2i+2$.
To "heapify" an array means to generate a permutation of an array meeting the heap property, when interpreted as a heap stored as an array.\\
\subsection*{The Algorithm}
\indent This parallel implementation of a heapify algorithm runs in $\Theta(\log n)$ span, but with $\Theta(2^n)$ work, where $n$ is the size of the input array.\\
\indent The algorithm functions by completing a series of subproblems in parallel, and then using compiling some of the results.
Specifically, the algorithm finds the maximum of every single subset of the array, and then determines the left and right subheaps in that subset.
These two sets of results are easily compiled into a heap with a recursive subroutine.

\section*{Proof of Correctness}
\begin{description}
	\item{\bf Exponent:}\\*
	Lemma: Exponent returns $b^k$\\*
	Proof by induction on $k$:\\*
	\begin{description}
		\item{Base Case:} $k=0$\\*
		Then the loop never iterates, so the procedure correctly returns $b^0=1$.\\*
		\item{Induction Step:} The loop correctly produces the answer for the last $i<k$ steps.\\*
		Consider the first step. If $k\nmid 2$, then $r$ is multiplied by $b$.\\*
		Then, by the induction hypothesis, the procedure correctly computes
		$r=r*(b^2)^{\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\right\rfloor}=b^{k-k\mod2}$.\\*
		Case 1: $k\mod 2=0$. In this case, since $r$ is not initially multiplied by $b$,
			at the end $r=1\times b^{k-0}=b^k$.\\*
		Case 2:	$k\mod 2=1$. In this case, since $r$ is initially multiplied by $b$,
			at the end $r=b\times b^{k-1}=b^{1+k-1}=b^k$.\\*
	\end{description}
	Thus, the procudure is correct by the principle of induction.

	\item{\bf Location of Maximum:}\\*
	Assume that the maximum is at location $i$.\\*
	Proof by induction on $h-f+1$
	that the function will always return the maximum in the given range if there is one:\\*
	\begin{description}
		\item{Base case:} $h-f+1\leq1$:\\*
		If $h-f+1=1$,
		then the function is defined as returning the only value in the input.\\*
		If $h-f+1=0$,
		then the function is defined as returning
		a value less than the codomain of the input.\\*
		\item{Induction step:} Assume true for all $m\leq n$ such that $h-f+1=m$, where $m,n\in\NN$.\\*
		We will now show that the function returns the correct value for $h-f+1=n+1>1$:\\*
		Then, since $h-f+1>1$, the base cases are ignored.\\*
		Let \verb|left| and \verb|right| be defined as they are in the function.\\*
		By the induction hypothesis, \verb|left| and \verb|right| are both less than or equal
		to the maximum in the full range, since they were made by recusion on subranges,
		and recursion on an empty subrange returns a value less than the whole of the codomain.\\*
		If $\verb|left.value|\neq\verb|right.value|$, then the function trivially returns the maximum.\\*
		If $\verb|left.value|=\verb|right.value|$, then the function returns the leftmost of the two,
		so the maximum is returned, since both are the maximum.
		Note that the function checks the index given, so no assumptions about the correct choices
		of subranges must be made.\\*
	\end{description}
	Thus, the procudure is correct by the principle of induction.

	\pagebreak
	\item{\bf Count:}\\*
	Proof by induction on $h-f$:
	\begin{description}
		\item{Base Cases:} $h-f\leq1$\\*
		If $valid(h-f)=0$, then the algorithm returns $0$, as expected
		since if $h-f=-1$, then the count is trivial, and if
		$h=f$ but also $2^f\land c\neq 2^f$, then the single number
		shuld not be included, so the count is appropriately zero.\\*
		If $valid(h-f)=1$, then the algorithm reutrns $1$, as expected,
		since this case is reduced to by then checking if $h=f$ anyway.
		\item{Induction Step:}
		Assume for all $n<n_0$, the algorithm is correct.
		So, since the algorithm returns the count of the left and right
		subarrays, which have strictly less count since $n_0\geq 2$.
		Thus, since the two paritions have no overlap and their union
		is the original array set, the algorithm is correct by the principle
		of induction.
	\end{description}
	Thus, the procudure is correct by the principle of induction.

	\item{\bf SubheapCount:}\\*
	Lemma: $\forall m\in\NN, \sum_{n=0}^m2^n=2^{m+1}-1$.
	Proof by induction on $m$:
	\begin{description}
		\item{Base Case:} $m=0$\\*
		Then, $\sum_{n=0}^m2^n=2^0=1=2-1=2^{1}-1=2^{0+1}-1=2^{m+1}-1$.\\*
		\item{Induction Step:} Assume true for $m\geq0$.\\*
		We will show that it remains true for $m+1$:
		$\sum_{n=0}^{m+1}2^n=\left(\sum_{n=0}^{m}2^n\right)+2^{m+1}$.\\*
		By the induction hypothesis,
		$\left(\sum_{n=0}^{m}2^n\right)+2^{m+1}=2^{m+1}-1+2^{m+1}=2\times2^{m+1}-1=2^{m+2}-1$,
		as expected.
	\end{description}
	Now, continuing on with the proof:\\*
	We will show that this procedure correctly produces the correct count
	of nodes that should be placed in the left subheap of the given subrange from $i$ to $n-1$.\\*
	By the correctness of \verb|Count|, the correct number of valid nodes in the range are determined.
	Call this number $a$.\\*
	Then, since the maximum is not included in either subheap, $a-1$ values must be placed into the
	two subheaps.\\*
	As the number of nodes at each height of a complete binary tree is a power of two, the same must be
	true of all but the last row of both subheaps, as they are near-complete trees.
	Thus, the number of nodes in an entire heap aside from the last row would be
	one less than a power of two (by our lemma).\\*
	$sub+1$ is defined to be the largest power of two less than or equal to $\frac{a-1}{2}$.\\*
	Therefore, $sub$ is the number of nodes in the left subheap, except for the final row.\\*
	$rem$ is thus defined to be the number of nodes in the last row of the left subheap.\\*
	Thus, $sub+rem$ is the number of nodes in the left subheap, so it is also the relative index
	of the first value in the right subheap (although not the index within the input array, due
	to the use of combinations).\\*
	Therefore, it is appropriately placed in \verb|mids[i]|.

	\pagebreak
	\item{\bf SubheapFind:}\\*
	We will show that this procedure produces the correct left and right subheap combinations.\\*
	\verb|maxPos| is set to be the index of the maximum value, represented as an integer so that
	it can be used in bitwise operations, and is correct by the correctness of the maximum location
	function.\\*
	Then, $k$ is defined as the minimum value such that
	$arr\_count[((powLookup[k]-1)\ \&\ (\neg maxPos))]\geq mids[i]$,
	so $midloc$ is the binary number of only $1$'s such that
	$arr\_count[(midloc\ \&\ (\neg maxPos))]\geq mids[i]$.\\*
	Thus, if and only if an included value should be in the right subheap, its index is $1$ in midloc.\\*
	Therefore, $i\ \&\ (midloc)\ \&\ (\neg maxPos)$ is the combination of the right subheap, since the
	invalid indeces and the previous maximum are filtered out.\\*
	Likewise, $i\ \&\ (\neg midloc)\ \&\ (\neg maxPos)$ is the combination of the left subheap.\\*

	\item{\bf Complete Heap:}\\*
	Proof by induction on the size of the range given by the combination $c$ (call this $r$):
	\begin{description}
		\item{Base Case:} $r=0$\\*
		Since no values are in the range, $c=0$, since otherwise $c$ would give at least one value.
		Thus, the function returns with no necessary action.\\*
		\item{Induction Step:} Assume that the function is correct for all $r<r_0$, where $r_0,r\in\NN$\\*
		We will show that the function is correct for $r_0$.\\*
		\begin{description}
			\item{Case 1:} If $i\geq n$, then the index is beyond the range of the array,
			so the combination number is undefined,
			and thus the function appropriately returns immediately.\\*
			\item{Case 2:} If $i<n$, then the index is within the range of the array.\\*
			So, since there must be at least one included number in the combination, a maximum
			must exist.\\*
			Thus, by the correctness of the maximum location function, $H[i]$ is set to be the value
			fetched from the input array.\\*
			By the induction hypothesis, the remainder of the heap is created correctly.\\*
		\end{description}
	\end{description}
	Thus, the procudure is correct by the principle of induction.

	\item{\bf Parallel Heapify:}\\*
	If there is at most one value in the array, then the array is already a heap,
	so a duplicate is appropriately returned.\\*
	Since there are $n$ values in the array, for any given combination, each of those values
	is either included or excluded, so the number of combinations is the number of binary
	numbers with $n$ digits, of which there are $2^n$, which is calculated correctly by the
	correctness of the exponent function.\\*
	By the correctness of the exponent and maximum location functions, $powLookup$ and $arr\_max$
	are correctly filled.\\*
	By the correctness of the subheap count function, $mids$ is correctly filled.\\*
	By the correctness of the subheap find function, $arr\_left$ and $arr\_right$ are correctly filled.\\*
	By the correctness of the complete heap function, $R$ is correctly filled.\\*
	Therefore, $R$ is a heapification of the input array $A$ upon its return, so the function is correct.

\end{description}

\section*{Proof of (Parallel) Runtime}
Only parallel span will be analyzed:
\begin{description}
	\item{\bf Exponent:}\\*
		Since $k$ is halved at every step, and all other operations internally run at $O(1)$,
		the procedure runs in $O(\log k)$ time.
	\item{\bf Location of Maximum, Count, Completion:}
		Let $n=h-f$ for a given input.\\*
		The runtime analysis for these three procedures are identical,
		since they all follow the same form.\\*
		Then, the runtime of this procedure runs under the recurrence relation
		$$T(n)=\max\left(T\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor\right),
		+T\left(\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil\right)\right)+O(1),$$
		which is trivially solved to find $T(n)\in O(\log n)$.
	\item{\bf SubheapCount:}\\*
		Let $n$ be the input $n$.\\*
		All operations other than the binary search and count should run in $O(1)$ time,
		so the overall runtime should be $O(\log n)$,
		since the the binary search runs in $O(\log n)$ time even in a poor implementation
		(it can be even better with good bounds).
	\item{\bf SubheapFind:}\\*
		Similarly to SubheapCount, the binary search is the limiting factor,
		which can run in $O(\log n)$ time at worst.
	\item{\bf Parallel Heapify:}\\*
		In addition to several $O(1)$ calls, this procedure consists several calls:
		\begin{description}
			\item{Exponent:} The first call runs in $O(\log n)$ time,
			and following set of $n$ parallel calls all each run in $O(\log n)$ time,
			so the as a whole the operations run in $O(\log n)$ time.
			\item{Location of Maximum:} $2^n$ parallel calls each run in $O(\log n)$ time,
			so as a whole the operations run in $O(\log n)$ time.
			\item{SubheapCount:} $2^n$ parallel calls each run in $O(\log n)$ time,
			so as a whole the oeprations run in $O(\log n)$ time.
			\item{SubheapFind:} $2^n$ parallel calls each runi n $O(\log n)$ time,
			so as a whole the oeprations run in $O(\log n)$ time.
			\item{Complete:} A single call runs in $O(\log n)$ time.
		\end{description}
		Since a bounded, finite number of calls each run in $O(\log n)$ time,
		the procedure as a whole runs in $O(\log n)$ time.
\end{description}
