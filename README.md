# pHeapify
This is a parallel heapify algorithm made to run in logarithmic span, at the cost of exponential work.
You can find a full description of the algorithm in PDF form from the
[releases section](https://github.com/jacketsj/pHeapify/releases).  
Also included is an implementation of the algorithm in C++11 using the OpenMP library,
although it is limited in use due to bounds on integer size with the library.
